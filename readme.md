# brightwheel-sample-app

> A sample application showing how to use [Brightwheel](https://github.com/loranallensmith/brightwheel) components in an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) project.

## Overview

This is a prototype for an Electron music player built with Brightwheel components.  It generates a basic user interface for demonstrating different components, but the application itself is non-functional.
